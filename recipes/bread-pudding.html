	<h3>
		Description
	</h3>
	<p>This recipe is proof-positive that leftover bread can easily be converted to dessert without much work.</p>
	<p>There’s room for customization here: consider adding fresh or dried fruit or a combination of spices like cinnamon,
		nutmeg, allspice and cardamom.</p>
	<p>It makes a great brunch dish, served with fresh fruit compote. Or add a handful of chocolate chips before baking
		for a decidedly more decadent outcome.</p>
	<h3>
		Ingredients
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups milk</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons (¼ stick) unsalted butter, more for greasing pan</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
		<li>Pinch salt</li>
		<li>1/2 loaf sweet egg bread like challah or brioche, cut into 2-inch cubes (about 5 to 6 cups)</li>
		<li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
		Directions
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt.
			Continue cooking just until butter melts; cool. Meanwhile, butter a 4-to-6-cup baking dish and fill it with cubed
			bread.</li>
		<li>Add eggs to cooled milk mixture and whisk; pour mixture over bread. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until custard
			is set but still a little wobbly and edges of bread have browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
	</ol>
